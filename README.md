## Description
The webapp contains allows one to search for User profiles and Repositories from Github as well as view info associated to each.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* The github page is currently live thus the following link will take you to the webpage "https://donaldkiplagat.github.io/Github/"
* As long as you have a compatible browser the document will work.
* Internet Connection is required to initiate API connection

### Known Bugs
Due to API restrictions one can only make a limited number of requests.


### Behaviour Driven Development
* The program should return a user's profile details when the correct username is entered in the User Profile section.<br> 
Input Example:"donaldkiplagat "<br>
Output Example: "Donald Kiplagat's information is displayed"

* The program should return repositories in relation to the search term the user enters in the Repositories section.<br>
Input Example:"Calculator"<br>
Output Example: "Repositories with the keyword 'calculator' are returned" <br>

* When the user clicks on the repository link it should redirect them to the github site for that repository.<br>
Input Example: "Maze"<br>
Output Exaple: Redirection to 'Maze' github site

* When the user clicks on 'Visit Github Site' on a user's profile they should be redirected to the user's github site.


### Technologies Used
* HTML was used in making the skeleton of the website.
* CSS and Bootstrap was used in styling the document.
* Atom was the source code editor of choice.
* Git and Github were used as my local and online repositories respectively.
* AngularCLI was used in creating the components/classes/directives/pipes needed in the web-app
* Github's API and Access Token was used in creating the connection to Github.
